We can see that there is a good correlation between the weight of the mouse and the volume of the tumor.
The correlation coeffienct was 0.84, which backs this up. We also found that the most effective drugs of the 4 we dove into were Ramicane and Capomulin.
These two drugs produced similar results and both mostly resulted in the shrining of the tumors in these trials.
The Gender split between the mice proved to be even, giving a good slice of what a larger population trial would look like.
The variables in this study were not as consitient as they should be. The 8 drugs for 248 mice is not a larger enough sample size to prove anything outright.
The amount of time varied for each mouse as well. While 63 of our 100 mice had full 45 day studies completed, some mice did not even have a timepoint past 0 days.
This could be because of side effects that killed these participants or poor scientific research.
